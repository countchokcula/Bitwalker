### When I first programmed this I was very unfamiliar with computer science but knew c++ decently> I now understand what a bit represents and can very easily simplify this program
This is just a program that does that SHA-256 algorithm and is based off of a youtube video of someone solving a bitcoin hash by hand. It can possibly solve bitcoins but only if they are of smaller hashes as i've notice it can't handle really big numbers. 
One major flaw is that i used std::arrays instead of std::vectors and had a severe lack of knowledge in a fundamental aspect of pointers so i did not take advantage of them. Opencl is not functioning. I'm on a 64bit AMD FX processor(x86-64 instruction set) if you're concerned with that. I made this in windows 10 Home
