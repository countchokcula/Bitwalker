# Bitwalker
This is just a program that does that SHA-256 algorithm. It can possibly solve bitcoins but only if they are of smaller hashes as i've notice it can't handle really big numbers. 
One major flaw is that i used std::arrays instead of vectors. Opencl is not functioning BTW
I've made this in visual studio and I've only made it compatible with windows 10 Home. I'm on a 64bit AMD FX processor if you're concerned with that
